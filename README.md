# Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
Megan is stronger at utilizing Front-End abilities
Jose is stronger at utilizing Back-End abilities

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
Megan will mainly take on the front-end aspect of this application while Jose handles the back-end.

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
Knowing what we are going to do on a day-to-day basis and switch navigator

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
by taking the time to speak with TA's and do outside research in order to establish coding skills

- Conflict Resolution
It would not occur since pair programming will be our core philosophy.

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
Open communication and writing down credit to see if it equals out

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
open communication
